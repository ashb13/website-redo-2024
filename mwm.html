                    <p>The client is a doctor and university professor with a consulting business that teaches people how to incorporate movement into their work and daily lives. I was tasked to create branding and a website to help kickstart her business. While I will not be covering the branding side of things in this study, it was fun to do!</p>

                <h2>Challenges and Goals</h2>
                <p class="bottom-spacing">This was a deceptively simple project. During initial planning, the website just needed a few pages and a few modules here and there.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <ul class="bottom-spacing">
                    <li>Create a design that was eyecatching, while staying relatively simple.</li>
                    <li>CMS constraints limited some things I could do</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul class="bottom-spacing">
                    <li>Keep the design modern, fun, and convey motion.</li>
                    <li>Make information scannable and easy to find.</li>
                    <li>Site should be engaging enough to keep users from immediately bouncing.</li>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>Due to the size of the website, the head of design said we weren't going to spend the time to wireframe anything so we went straight to design. I was feeling a little better about it because I had just done all of the branding so I had a pretty good idea of what the website should look and feel like. I included a lot of wavy lines and soft edges to incorporate the feeling of motion without having to actually inlude animations, as those are a little more expensive. The color palette really lent itself to that as well.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot in regards to designing in a different style other than just making something modern. So far, the site is performing pretty well and there haven't been any complaints from the client. There were a few things I would have done differently, as the amount of copy I was originally accounting for was not nearly enough for the amount that ended up in the final website.</p>
