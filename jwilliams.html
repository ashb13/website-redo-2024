                    <h3>project overview</h3>
                    <p>An industrial contractor in North Florida that was in need of an updated website. Their old website was very bland and was missing a lot of necessary information for potential clients. My job was to update it and make the information easy to find.</p>

                <h2>Challenges and Goals</h2>
                <p class="bottom-spacing">There was a lot of information to organize on this website. Mostly, it had to do with all of the different industries served and the services provided. I had a tough time figuring out a good way to organize it all but I think it worked out well.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <ul class="bottom-spacing">
                    <li>Create a design that was modern and organized.</li>
                    <li>Lots of information to make digestable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul class="bottom-spacing">
                    <li>Keep the design modern, engaging, and easy to follow.</li>
                    <li>Make information scannable and easy to find.</li>
                    <li>Have reusable components to cut down on dev time.</li>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p class="bottom-spacing">To begin, I conducted research on competitors and other key players in adjacent markets to see what types of things I might need to incorporate in the design and much needed inspiration. Upon completion, I started to lay out everything in the design. A few iterations were needed to get to the final product in terms of wireframes, but once that was done, I were able to move on to design phase.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p class="bottom-spacing">Things really started to come together once images and color was added to the design. A few more changes had to be made in accordance with some modules the client wanted to add in after wireframes were completed. Due to the nature of the job, I wasn't given time to go back to wireframes to test things out so I had to just run with it and keep moving. This ended up changing the layout of some things due to a few modules now being conflicting, but I made it work.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Though I am happy with the overall design, there are a few things I think I would change about it. The sections listing services works really well on mobile, but it's not quite as intuitive as I would like on desktop. As it is now, it is still perfectly useable though.</p>
